  Build a Real-Time Chat App with Node.js and WebSockets
  
I recently built a simple Node.js WebSocket server to test how web browsers and web servers communicate with each other in real time. I used the WS library to create the WebSocket server, and I emulated the client and server sides. I also used Express to serve static files from the public directory and to define a simple root route.

WebSockets are a communication protocol that allows for full-duplex communication between a web browser and a web server. This means that both the browser and the server can send and receive messages at the same time.
WebSockets are useful for building real-time applications, such as chat apps, multiplayer games, and live dashboards.
